# RoRR-Save-Editor
Python script to edit save files of Risk of Rain returns to unlock characters, achievements, etc.

I have never created shit on GitHub or saved modding in general so this is a first-time project, so sorry if it's trash.


# How to Use:
Download Latest Release (Should be on the left of github.com)

Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\ (random numbers (logged in steam accounts)) \1337520\remote\

Place Main.py and Run in here (Alternatily you can copy main.py and save.json and use it somewhere else)

Run and make your edit selections

Start the game and it should unlock what ever you selected

#  ðŸš¨ Make a Copy of your save.json in case it breaks ðŸš¨
if it breaks you gotta restart all your progress so don't be dumb

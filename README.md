# Risk of Rain Returns Save-Editor
Python script to edit save files of Risk of Rain returns to unlock characters, achievements, etc. ( Just Characters for now)

I have never created shit on GitHub or saved modding in general so this is a first-time project, so sorry if it's trash.


# How to Use:
Download Latest Release (Should be on the left of github.com)

Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\ (random numbers (logged in steam accounts)) \1337520\remote\

Place Main.py and Run in here (Alternatily you can copy main.py and save.json and use it somewhere else)

Run and make your edit selections

Start the game and it should unlock what ever you selected





# Option 2
If you do not want to run code on your system, or don't have python;
Go to Repl.it
Create an Account
Create a project ( Make sure to select python )
Copy & Paste Code into the project
upload your save.json to the files
Finally hit Run!

Then copy and paste the save.json back to your system







#  ðŸš¨ Make a Copy of your save.json in case it breaks ðŸš¨
if it breaks you gotta restart all your progress so don't be dumb
